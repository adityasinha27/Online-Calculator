# Online-Calculator
Project Description – Online Calculator
This project is a fully functional Online Calculator built using core web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to perform all basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage calculation, and decimal operations. The calculator provides a smooth and interactive user experience, with a modern and responsive user interface.

The main objective of this project was to reinforce my understanding of front-end web development concepts, including:

Structuring web pages using semantic HTML

Styling with modern CSS, including layout design, gradients, and shadows

Implementing real-time logic and interactivity with JavaScript

Key features include:

A clean and intuitive layout resembling real-world calculators

Real-time input and result display

Functional buttons: AC to clear, DEL to delete last character, = to evaluate

Responsive design suitable for desktop and mobile devices

Color-coded operators for better usability

The JavaScript logic handles user input through event listeners and dynamically updates the calculator display. The use of the eval() function simplifies expression evaluation (note: in production apps, this should be replaced with a safer custom parser).

This project not only strengthened my technical skills but also helped me understand how to build an interactive web application from scratch. It serves as a solid foundation for more complex calculators or future upgrades such as:

Scientific mode

Keyboard input support

Calculation history
